# Look-A-Bird
Mobile birdwatching app with GPS mapping, community sharing, and profile management for tracking and discovering bird species.
Use Case
The user begins with authentication through the login screen, which leads to a central home interface that provides access to the application's three main features. Users can navigate to an interactive map that displays bird sighting locations and helps identify productive birding areas. The posting feature allows users to create and share their bird observations with the community, including the ability to edit these posts when needed. The profile section enables users to manage their personal information and view their birding history, while also allowing other community members to explore each user's contributions and expertise. This workflow creates a complete cycle where users can discover locations, document their findings, share knowledge with others, and build their reputation within the birding community, ultimately contributing to a collaborative platform for bird observation data and communityÂ engagement.
